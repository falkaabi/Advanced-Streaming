# Advanced Streaming using OpenCV

This repository contains various Python scripts demonstrating different methods of video streaming and processing using OpenCV. 

## Scripts

1. [camera_stream_multithreading.py](./1.camera_stream_multithreading.py): This script demonstrates how to stream video from a camera using multithreading for improved performance.

2. [ip_camera_stream.py](./2.ip_camera_stream.py): This script shows how to stream video from an IP camera. It also includes a function to maintain the aspect ratio of the video.

3. [multiple_camera_streams.py](./3.multiple_camera_streams.py): This script demonstrates how to capture and display video streams from multiple cameras simultaneously using PyQt4.

4. [real_time_streaming_sync.py](./4.real_time_streaming_sync.py): This script shows how to capture and display a real-time video stream with frame synchronization.

5. [rtsp_to_video_file.py](./5.rtsp_to_video_file.py): This script demonstrates how to capture a video stream from an RTSP link and save it to a video file.

6. [opencv_video_saving.py](./6.opencv_video_saving.py): This script shows how to capture video from multiple sources and save them to separate video files.

7. [multiprocessing_video_capture.py](./7.multiprocessing_video_capture.py): This script demonstrates how to capture video using multiprocessing for improved performance.

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. Some scripts require a video source such as a camera or video file. Please replace the placeholder values with your actual video source.
